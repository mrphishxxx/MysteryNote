# MysteryNote

## Synopsis

Project allows you to send a text message from a central phone number using Twilio.  It also allows the receiver to send a message back using a unique (but anonymous) identifier as the beginning of the message.

Note that Apple does not allow such apps on the Apple Store, so this is merely for curiosity.

This app works for both iPhone and iPad devices.

## Details

The app allows you to enter in the recipient's phone number, a text message, and your phone number to allow for the recipient to text message you back.

## Installation

First, create a Twilio account, and replace the following strings in AnonTextViewController.swift: 

    let twilio_accountsid_LIVE = "TWILIO LIVE ACCOUNT ID"
    let twilio_authtoken_LIVE = "TWILIO AUTH TOKEN"
    let twilio_phone = "TWILIO PHONE NUMBER"

Second, add an app in Parse, and replace the following strings in AppDelegate.swift:

     Parse.setApplicationId("PARSE ID", clientKey: "PARSE CLIENT KEY");

Third, in Parse, create a class TextID, with a text field named "phone".
